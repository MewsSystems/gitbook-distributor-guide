# Prerequisites for use cases

* You have followed [Getting started guide](../getting-started.md) and understand how Distributor Widget is installed.
* Some familiarity with JavaScript and HTML.
* Code needs to be served from secure location over HTTPS. If you serve it from insecure HTTP site, you will be redirected to the [standalone Distributor](../../distributor-standalone/README.md) and the code will not work. For testing and experimenting, you can also use service such as [CodePen](https://codepen.io).
* Modern browser (ideally [latest Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox](https://browserslist.dev/?q=bGFzdCAxIENocm9tZSB2ZXJzaW9uLCBsYXN0IDEgRmlyZWZveCB2ZXJzaW9u)). Distributor works in older/other browsers, but custom code of the use cases is not guaranteed to work in them. You can of course modify the code to make it work.
