# Deeplinks

With deeplinks you can create URLs which, when used, open Distributor standalone in some predefined setup. For example with a specific currency or dates. 

You can deeplink into a standalone Distributor from other websites by passing [supported parameters](./deeplinks.md#supported-parameters) in a URL query. For example like this:

```text
https://api.mews.com/distributor/aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeeeee?currency=EUR&mewsRoute=rates&mewsRoom=aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeeeee
```

## Supported parameters 

Parameters can be combined and some have no visible effect unless they are used in combination (e.g. `mewsHotel`).
