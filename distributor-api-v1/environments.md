# Environments

## Staging/Testing environment

This environment is meant to be used during implementation of the client applications. We have prepared one hotel where you can fetch availability and create reservation. You can use the following information to access it:

* **API base url** - `https://api.mews-demo.com`
* **Hotel Id** - `3edbe1b4-6739-40b7-81b3-d369d9469c48`
* **Configuration Id** - `93e27b6f-cba7-4e0b-a24a-819e1b7b388a`

You will also have access into the system so it is possible for you to check whether the reservations sent to the API are correctly posted to the system. To sign into the system, use the following credentials:

* **Mews applications base url** - `https://app.mews-demo.com`
* **Email** - `distributor-api@mews.li`
* **Password** - `Distributor-api1`

## Production environment

* **API base url** - `https://api.mews.com`
* **Mews applications base url** - `https://app.mews.com`
