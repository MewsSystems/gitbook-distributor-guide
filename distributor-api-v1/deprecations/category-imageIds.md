# Room category ImageIds deprecation
`ImageIds` field of [room category](../operations.md#room-category) object is deprecated and will be removed from the responses of [configuration/get](../operations.md#get-configuration) and [hotels/get](../operations.md#get-hotels). It is replaced by [Category image assignment](../operations.md#category-image-assignment) on [configuration/get](../operations.md#get-configuration) endpoint. This will mainly allow you to get more information for that image, such is `Ordering` field that can be used for displaying the images in specific order.
